## Task A (1st PR)

- Implement `isLoading` method extension of the view, which should return some View with loading mode
- You should send to this method `Bool` value as indicator of loading status or not
- Use `@ViewBuilder` for this method
- Loading should simple as `ProgressView` in center of content (instead of content)

## Task B (2nd PR)

- Add option as `reducted` mode of loading, instead of `progress view`
